OMPL, the Open Motion Planning Library, consists of many state-of-the-art
sampling-based motion planning algorithms. OMPL itself does not contain any
code related to, e.g., collision checking or visualization. This is a
deliberate design choice, so that OMPL is not tied to a particular collision
checker or visualization front end.
