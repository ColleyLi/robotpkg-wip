The Fast Research Interface Library intends to provide a simple user
interface to the KUKA Light-Weight Robot IV and hides all
communication and set-up issues behind interface. It is only an
interface and it does not contain any control functionalities. Without
much installation efforts, access to different controller interfaces
of the KUKA system is provided:

    Joint position controller,
    Cartesian impedance controller, and
    Joint position controller.

The Fast Research Interface Library runs on a remote PC node with is
connected to the KRC (KUKA Robot Controller) via an Ethernet
connection. In intervals of 1 to 100 milliseconds, UDP packages are
periodically sent from the KRC unit to the remote host. These packages
contain a complete set of robot control and status data (e.g., joint
positions, joint torques, drive FRIDriveTemperatures, etc.; cf. FRI
User Documentation). Users become able to set-up own control
architectures and/or application-specific controllers for the
light-weight arm as it is often desired at research institutions.

KRL files (to be installed on the KRC) are installed in 
${PREFIX}/share/FRILibrary
