The MPC library propose several motion planning algorithms that may be devided
into three parts :

    - Local motion planning: real-time motion planning of a path or a trajectory
      between two close end points.
      Two main algorithms:
        - A non-holonomic path generator using straight lines, circle bows and clothoids
        - A variational trajectory generator by constraints optimization
          designed to be used with arbitrary system dynamics 

    - Global motion planning: deliberative motion planning to compute a
      complete path or trajectory amidst static obstacles between two end
      points.
      Four main algorithms:
        - A* search on a probabilitic roadmap
        - A* search on a probabilistic occupancy grid using target and
          obstacles potential fields
        - Trajectory refinement thanks to the variational trajectory generator
        - Path-velocity decomposition for arbitrary system dynamics 

    - Reactive obstacle avoidance : Real-time algorithms allowing to move
      safely amongst static and dynamic obstacles.
      Three main algorithms :
        - A trajectory selection algorithm computing several candidate motions
          to execute and selecting the best one
        -  A trajectory tracking algorithm aimed at following a reference
           trajectory and avoiding obstacles without going out of a reference
           corridor
        - A trajectory deformation process aimed at anticipating the motion of
          dynamic obstacles while keeping the convergence to the goal
