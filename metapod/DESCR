This software provides robot dynamics algorithms. It uses a
combination of a specific representation of robot models and C++
templates, such that each algorithm remains model-independant, yet is
optimized for a particular robot at compile-time.

As of today, the following algorithms have been implemented:
- RNEA (Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm) for inverse dynamics.
