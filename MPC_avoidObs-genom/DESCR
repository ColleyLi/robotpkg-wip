The MPC avoidObs module encapsulates several navigation algorithms. All of them
are closed-loop algorithms, taking as input the localization provided by the
POM genom module, and they have been focused on navigating in either flat or
rough terrain, taking a data elevation map (DEM) as model of the environment
provided by the DTM genom module. The main algorthms provided here are : 

    - A trajectory selection approach : a reactive navigation method allowing
      to navigate in a unknown environment by computing at each time step a set
      of candidate trajectories and selecting the best one

    - A trajectory following with obstacle avoidance approach : a reactive
      method trying to follow a reference trajectory while avoiding unforseen
      obstacles 

Every navigation method provides at each time step a parametric continuous
control trajectory (continuous sequence of input commands) until a given time
horizon.
