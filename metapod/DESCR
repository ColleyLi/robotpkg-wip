This software provides robot dynamics algorithms. It uses a
combination of a specific representation of robot models and C++
templates, such that each algorithm remains model-independant, yet is
optimized for a particular robot at compile-time.

As of today, the following algorithms have been implemented:
- RNEA (Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm) for inverse dynamics.

This software is designed to be a low-level library, performance is
thus a key issue. For increased performance, it is strongly
recommended to add the "-march=native -mfpmath=sse" flags to the
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable before compiling it.
