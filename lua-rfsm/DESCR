rFSM is a small and powerful Statechart implementation. It is mainly designed
for Coordination of complex systems but is not limited to that. rFSM is written
in pure Lua and is therefore highly portable and embeddable. As a Lua
domain specific language rFSM inherits the extensibility of its host
language.
