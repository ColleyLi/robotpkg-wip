msgconnector is the communication library for HATP

This library includes a server and client definition. It should be used in
any software that has to communicate with HATP.
When a client starts, it registeres itself to the server. Then when another
client wnats to communicate it needs to use the name of the first client, 
the server will relay the message to the correct client. There must not
be two clients with the same name because if one leaves then when the second
will leave ther server will crash.
