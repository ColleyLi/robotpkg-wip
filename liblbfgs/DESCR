This library is a C port of the implementation of Limited-memory 
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method written by Jorge Nocedal. The 
original FORTRAN source code is available at: 
http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgs.html
The L-BFGS method solves the unconstrainted minimization problem,

    minimize F(x), x = (x1, x2, ..., xN),

only if the objective function F(x) and its gradient G(x) are computable. The 
well-known Newton's method requires computation of the inverse of the hessian 
matrix of the objective function. However, the computational cost for the inverse 
hessian matrix is expensive especially when the objective function takes a large 
number of variables. The L-BFGS method iteratively finds a minimizer by 
approximating the inverse hessian matrix by information from last m iterations. 
This innovation saves the memory storage and computational time drastically for 
large-scaled problems.
