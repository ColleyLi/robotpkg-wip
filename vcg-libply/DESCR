This is the VCG modified PLY library, a modern C++ library for parsing the PLY
file format.

PLY library was initially written by Greg Turk
(http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk). Claudio Rocchini
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rocchini) tuned it for C++. VCG comes with
some improvements to make it better suit the templated C++ VCG Library.
