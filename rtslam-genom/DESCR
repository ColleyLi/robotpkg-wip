RT-SLAM stands for Real Time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping).

RT-SLAM is a fast Slam library and test framework based on EKF. Its main
qualities are:
	- genericity: for sensor models, landmark types, landmark models, landmarks
	reparametrization, biases estimation;
	- speed: real time at 60 fps (VGA, gray level) on a decent machine (at
	least one Core2 core at 2.2GHz)
	- flexibility: different estimation/image processing sequencing strategies
	(active search), independent base brick for a hierarchical multimap and
	multirobots architecture;
	- robustness: near-optimal repartition of landmarks, data association
	errors detection (gating, ransac);
	- developer-friendly: visualization tools (2D and 3D), offline replay step
	by step, logs, simulation.

For now it provides:
	- Landmarks: Anchored Homogeneous Points (Inverse Depth) that can be
	reparametrized into Euclidean Points;
    - Sensors: Pinhole cameras;
    - Prediction: Constant velocity model, inertial sensor;
    - Data association: Active search, 1-point Ransac, and mixed strategies.
