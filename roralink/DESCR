Roralink is a tunnel application that allows seamless switches between
a Wifi connection and a wired connection. 

It was inspired by Willow Garage's robot-forward + wg-openvpn packages
for the PR2, but aims at beeing lighter to deploy.

For now this package only contains the client (robot side) component.
