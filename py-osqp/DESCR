The OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Program) solver is a numerical optimization package for solving problems in the form

minimize        0.5 x' P x + q' x

subject to      l <= A x <= u

where x in R^n is the optimization variable. The objective function is defined by a positive semidefinite matrix P in S^n_+ and vector q in R^n. The linear constraints are defined by matrix A in R^{m x n} and vectors l and u so that l_i in R U {-inf} and u_i in R U {+inf} for all i in 1,...,m.
