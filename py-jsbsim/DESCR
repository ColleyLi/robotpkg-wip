 JSBSim is an open source flight dynamics model (FDM) that compiles and runs
 under many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh,
 Linux, IRIX, Cygwin (Unix on Windows), etc. The FDM is essentially the
 physics/math model that defines the movement of an aircraft, rocket, etc.,
 under the forces and moments applied to it using the various control
 mechanisms and from the forces of nature. JSBSim has no native graphics. It
 can be run by itself as a standalone program, taking input from a script file
 and various vehicle configuration files. It can also be incorporated into a
 larger flight simulator implementation that includes a visual system. The most
 notable examples of the use of JSBSim are currently seen in the FlightGear
 (open source), Outerra, BoozSimulator (open source), and OpenEaagles (open
 source) simulators. JSBSim is also used to drive the motion-base research
 simulators at the University of Naples, Italy, and in the Institute of Flight
 System Dynamics and Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at RWTH Aachen
 University in Germany.
