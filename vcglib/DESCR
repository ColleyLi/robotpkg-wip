A portable C++ templated library for the manipulation, processing of triangle 
and tetrahedral meshes. The library, released under the GPL license, is the 
result of the collaborative efforts of the Visual Computing Lab of the ISTI 
- an institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR).

This package provides headers that permit creation, manipulation, read and 
write of meshes in several formats.
