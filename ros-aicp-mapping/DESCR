Auto-tuned Iterative Closest Point (AICP) is a module for laser-based localization and mapping (Nobili et al., ICRA 2017). The implementation of AICP includes a module for localization failure prediction (Nobili et al., ICRA 2018). The registration strategy is based on the libpointmatcher framework (Pomerleau et al., AR 2012).
